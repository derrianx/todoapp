# Project: Simple Todo List App

Description: A web app that allows users to create, update, and delete tasks in a to-do list.

## Tools and Technologies

ReactJS: a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces
Material-UI: a component library for React that provides pre-built UI components
Steps:

✅✅✅1. Set up a new React app using create-react-app or a similar tool.

2. Install Material-UI components and styles using npm or yarn.

3. Create a new component for the todo list and import Material-UI .components to be used in the app.

✅✅✅4. Implement a form to allow users to add new tasks to the list.

✅✅✅5. Implement the ability to update and delete tasks in the list.

6. Add styling and formatting to the app using Material-UI components and .styles.

7. Test the app to ensure it is functioning correctly.

8. Deploy the app to a hosting service, such as Netlify or Heroku.

Note: This is a very basic project and may not cover all the necessary features and functionality of a more robust to-do list app. The time required to implement this project may vary depending on your level of experience and familiarity with ReactJS and Material-UI.
